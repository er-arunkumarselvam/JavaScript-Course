JAVASCRIPT NOTES

What is JavaScript?

    - JavaScript is a lightweighted and interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions. It is a scripting Language for web pages.
    - JavaScript features are
            - protype-based
            - multi paradigm
            - single threaded
            - dynamic language
            - supporting oops concept
            - imperative and declarative(eg: functional programming)style.

Histroy of JavaScript?

    - JS was originally developed as "LiveScript" by Netscape in 1990's.
    - JS was created by "Brendan Eich" in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications.
    - JS is client-side scripting language used for web applications at that time.


    Note:

        "JavaScript is not JAVA". 

What are the applications or builing with using JS is possible?

    - Website Development
    - Web and Mobile applications
    - Desktop Applicaitons 
    - Game Development
    - Server-Side Development
    - Browser Extensions
    - Real Time Applicaitons
    - IoT
    - Machine Learning and AI

Why we should learn JS?

    - Easier to start with learn
    - Great career opportunities
    - Wide range of usage
    - Big community supporting
    - High Demand for Future 

What are the frameworks in JS?

    - React JS
    - Vue JS
    - Angular JS
    - React Native (Build Mobile Application)
    - ElectronJS and much more (Build Desktop Applicaiton)
    
How JS works?

    Old Method:

             run
    JS code ----> browser (Inbuilt JS Engine) ----> output

    for eg: Google Chrome (V8 JS Engine), FireFox Browser (Spidermonkey JS Engine)

    Limitation: For browser works only JS


    New Method: 

    - In 2009, Ryan Dahl (Scientist) introduce "JS Engine Wrapper into C++" it called as "Node".

    Using Node, we can create,

        - Web applications
        - Mobile applications
        - Backend applications

ECMA Script?

    - It is a Just a specification (set of rules).
    - JS to follow ECMA Script


JS Comments:

    // - Single Line Comment
    
    /* ... */ - Multiline Comment

How to run JavaScript in Node JS?

    - Already installed node JS
    - Check node version (using cmd)

        node -v (v18.17.1)

    - node js file name. eg: main.js

JavaScript Variable:

    - variable is a store in values and temporary memory allocation 

    syntax:

            var variableName = value;

        Ex:
            varibale name
                   |
                   |
            var message = "Hello, my name is arun, I'm Learning JavaScript";
             |                                  |
             |                                  |
    variable keyword                          value


            console.log(message);
    
    Variable Keyword:

        - var
        - let
        - const

    Shortcut Tip: console opening (F12) for chrome

    Concatnation Operator:

        "content" + variableName
        "content" + variableName + "conent"

    Without value in variable ---> Undefined

        Ex: let age;

    JavaScript is dynamically typed language. don't need a data type.

    Variable Naming Convention:

        - Don't use reserved JS keywords name. (eg: let break)
        - Should not start with numbers. (eg:5star)
        - No space and hypen (-) (eg:note-pad or full name)
        - It's Case-Sensitive (eg: fullName and FullName both are different.)
        - Use valuable name

    Tip: Variable name using "CamelCase" like fullName, getView and lastName, etc.,

    var vs let:

        var - old way of storing variables
        let - new way of storing variables (After Improvement of ES6+)


    const:

        - const variable don't change the value (don't override the values). But let or var (override the values).
        - const variable can't edit or modify the values.

        Error:

            Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

JavaScript Datatypes:

    - 2 types of Datatypes. there are "Primitive" and "Reference" Types

        Primitive Types                         Reference Types

            - String                                - Object
            - Integer/Number                        - Array
            - Float/Double                          - Function
            - Boolean
            - Undefined
            - null

    Statically Typed:

        - Datatype is defined. (C, C++, Java)

                    variableName
                        |
                        |
                String name = "Arunkumar"
                   |               |
                   |               |
                Datatype         value

    Dynamically Typed:

        - Datatype is not defined. (JavaScript, Python, PHP)

              variableName
                   |
                   |
                 name = "Arunkumar"
                            |
                            |
                          value

    Find the datatype ----> "typeof" keyword

                typeof variableName

        note: "null" is a Object Datatype
